# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Goal:
The goal of this project was to build a webpage that allows for the storage of journal events in a time block calendar showing each working hour of the day. The time block color should change to indicate whether that time block has passed, and the date should be displayed at the top of the page.

## How:
The HTML will house the individual time blocks that are classified by the hour that they represent. Styling will be based off of the CSS that was provided. In javascript, the current day and time will be declared using moment. Variables to store the save button feature will be declared. A function to save the event to local storage will be used as well. A function to change the color of the time blocks will utilize if/else to determine the current time of day and change the color accordingly.

## Why:
This assignment will display the students knowledge of third-party APIs to add style and function to webpage.

## Result:
The webpage is structured and styled according to the criteria. The time blocks change color based on the current time of day. Text can be input into the text area, and the save button can be pressed to save. Currently, the code does not function to save to local storage, and it cannot be retrieved from local storage either.
